initial change

## Loading the data

testing push 1-2-3

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
my_data <- committees %>% 
  left_join(contributions, by = "cmte_id") 
```
```{r}
my_data %>% select(cmte_id, transaction_amt, cmte_name, cmte_state, org_type, cmte_party_affiliation)
```

Thoughts:
* Comparisons of swing state and non-swing state
* Filter to one state showing interest group category
* Look at committee id columns between committee and contributions dataset to find a join
* Also recipient id column
* Work on committee master file and look at interest group or committee party
* Looking at one swing state and one non-swing state or one red, one blue
*
