initial change

## Loading the data

testing push 1-2-3

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

Thoughts:
* Comparisons of swing state and non-swing state
* Filter to one state showing interest group category
* Look at committee id columns between committee and contributions dataset to find a join
* Also recipient id column
* Work on committee master file and look at interest group or committee party
*
